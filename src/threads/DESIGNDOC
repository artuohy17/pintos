                 ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.


Added variable to struct thread in threads.h:
    
    int64_t sleep_ticks;            
    
    /* Ticks used in timersleep to indicate when thread is done sleeping. */

Added a list to timer.c:
    
    static struct list sleeping;

    A list that contains all currently sleeping threads sorted from lowest to highest sleep time.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

In the call to timer_sleep(), interrupts are disabled while the 
sleep_ticks variable is set equal to ticks (time thread is supposed 
to sleep) plus start (timer ticks since OS booted). The current 
thread is then added into sleeping (sorted list of sleeping threads) 
in the correct postion and blocked. In timer_interrupt() sleeping will
be traversed and any thread with a sleep_ticks value less than 
timer_ticks() will be unblocked and removed from sleeping.


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

By keeping the sleeping list sorted, timer_interrupt() doesn't need to 
traverse through the entire list it only needs to go as far as the first 
thread whose sleep_ticks is greater than timer_ticks(). Once it finds 
that thread it can stop its traversal which minimized the amount of time
spent in the timer interrupt handler.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Interrupts are disabled because ready and sleeers_ lists are modified in the 
interrupt handler. 
=======
Race conditions are avoided during simultaneous timer_sleep() calls by turning interrupts off while the sleep_ticks are calculated and added into sleeping.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Interrupts are disable to prevent the sleepers_list from being unstable when 
timer_interrupt occurs. 
=======
Race contiions are avoided during timer interrupt because interrupts are disabled while values are being added to sleeping list so no race conditions can  be created.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

<<<<<<< HEAD
We considered having the sleeping list unsorted because this would make 
adding the sleeping threads more efficient, but then most time would be 
spent traversing the list to awake the sleeping threads. Also, much more
time would be spent in the interrupt handler which would cause problems 
with a high number of sleeping threads. The run time would be comprimised 
with this implementation.
 
=======
We chose this design as a way to reimplement the timer_sleep() function without using busy-waiting. By putting threads to sleep for a certain number of ticks and then adding it to a list with the other sleeping threads we can use the timer_interrupt to determine which threads are ready to wake up and then unblock them.

             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

thead.h

int initial_priority; number of donations, returns to 0 after all donations have occured

struct thread *want_lock; threads waiting on locks

int base_priority; original priority before donations

struct lock *waiting_lock; lock that must be completed prior to the thread acquiring the lock
 
>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

L1, L2, L3 - Locks
T1, T2, T3, T4 - Threads

	L1
T1-->		L2
T2--> T3--> T4
	L3

T3 donation list = (T1, T2)
T4 donation list = (T3)

T3 priority = max(T1, T2, T3)
T4 priority = max(T4, T3)

T3 waiting lock = (L2)
T4 waiting lock = (NULL)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

Everytime donation is received it gets reordered in the list so that the first element
in the threads list has highest priorty. 

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

When lock_acquire() is called:

1) Lock is free
	Update the holder to reference the current thread, decrease semaphore value. Return.
2)Lock is held, requester has lower priorty
	set want_lock to current lock holder, once lock is free (lock_release), in lock_acquire() set the want_lock to NULL.
	set the holder to have reference to the current thread. Return.
3)Lock is held, requester has higher priorty
	Priorty Donation. Store previous priorty of the holder, check if current holder is null and if lock that is waiting
	on is !NULL, if true, nested priority donation occurs on the lock that is waiting on. Nesting complete, update the 
	priorty changed in the list, set want_lock() and wait for lock to be free.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

The holder is set to NULL, removes the thread' waiting on the lock released off the current thread list. Priority donation is gone
once lock released. Increment the semaphore value. Following lock_release() return, lock_acquire() will reset all priorities. Find
highest priority on thread's list. Highest priority thread acquires the released lock. If current thread has highest priorty, continue.
